## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. CLI Option Mapping Fixes

#### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
// Inconsistent option definitions
program.option('--proj', 'Project directory');  // In some commands
program.option('--project-dir', 'Project directory');  // In others
```

#### After (Standardized):
```typescript
// Unified option definitions across all commands
program.option('--project-dir <dir>', 'Project directory path');
program.option('--project <name>', 'Project name for multi-project mode');
```

**Resolution Impact**:
- ✅ All CLI commands now use consistent option naming
- ✅ Parameter validation prevents invalid inputs
- ✅ Help text standardized across all commands
- ✅ Error messages provide actionable guidance

### 2. Test Infrastructure Repairs

#### Test Environment Isolation
```typescript
// Robust test context management
export function setupTestEnvironment() {
  return () => {
    const tempDir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'aitrackdown-test-'));
    const cleanup = () => fs.rmSync(tempDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    return { tempDir, cleanup };
  };
}
```

#### Process Isolation Implementation
```typescript
// Proper child process management
function runCLICommand(args: string[], options: CLITestOptions) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const child = spawn('node', [cliPath, ...args], {
      cwd: options.workingDirectory,
      stdio: 'pipe',
      timeout: options.timeout || 30000
    });
    // Proper cleanup and error handling
  });
}
```

### 3. Multi-Project Architecture Enhancements

#### Project Detection Logic
```typescript
// Reliable project mode detection
export class ProjectDetector {
  static detectProjectMode(basePath: string): ProjectMode {
    const hasProjectsDir = fs.existsSync(path.join(basePath, 'projects'));
    const hasSingleConfig = fs.existsSync(path.join(basePath, '.ai-trackdown'));
    
    if (hasProjectsDir && !hasSingleConfig) return ProjectMode.MULTI;
    if (!hasProjectsDir && hasSingleConfig) return ProjectMode.SINGLE;
    return ProjectMode.AUTO_DETECT;
  }
}
```
