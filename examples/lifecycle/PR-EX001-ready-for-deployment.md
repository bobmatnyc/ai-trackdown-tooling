# PR: Authentication API Implementation

## Description
Complete implementation of authentication REST API including registration, login, logout, and password reset endpoints. All endpoints include proper validation, rate limiting, and security measures.

## State Transition History
- **2025-07-14T11:00:00Z**: Created in `planning` state by developer-alice
- **2025-07-14T12:30:00Z**: Transitioned to `active` by developer-alice
  - Reason: Started development after task dependencies completed
- **2025-07-14T15:15:00Z**: Transitioned to `ready_for_qa` by ci-pipeline
  - Reason: Code review passed, unit tests green
  - Automation eligible: Yes
- **2025-07-14T16:45:00Z**: Transitioned to `ready_for_deployment` by automated-testing-pipeline
  - Reason: All QA tests passed, security review approved
  - Reviewed by: qa-engineer-charlie
  - Approved by: security-lead-diana

## Implementation Summary

### API Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with email verification
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication with JWT response
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Token invalidation
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - JWT token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset initiation
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion
- `GET /api/auth/verify-email` - Email verification

### Security Features
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per minute per IP)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Password strength requirements
- JWT token with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token with 7-day expiration
- CSRF protection headers
- Audit logging for all auth events

## QA Testing Results
- ✅ All unit tests passing (100% coverage)
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Security penetration testing passed
- ✅ Performance tests meeting requirements
- ✅ Load testing completed (1000 concurrent users)
- ✅ Email delivery testing successful

## Security Review Results
- ✅ Code review by security team completed
- ✅ OWASP security checklist verified
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scan clean
- ✅ Authentication flow security approved
- ✅ Rate limiting effectiveness confirmed

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Email service configuration verified
- [ ] Load balancer configuration updated
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## Next State Transitions
When deployment is complete, this PR will transition to:
- **done**: Successfully deployed to production
  - Required metadata: deployment_timestamp, deployed_by
  - Automation eligible: Yes (if deployment pipeline succeeds)

## Files Changed
- `src/api/auth/routes.py` - Authentication endpoints
- `src/api/auth/validators.py` - Input validation
- `src/api/auth/middleware.py` - Rate limiting and CSRF
- `src/api/auth/models.py` - User and session models
- `src/utils/jwt_manager.py` - JWT token utilities
- `src/utils/email_service.py` - Email sending functionality
- `tests/api/test_auth.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/api/authentication.md` - API documentation

## Automation Configuration
```yaml
deployment_pipeline:
  triggers:
    - state: ready_for_deployment
    - approver: security-lead
  steps:
    - validate_environment
    - run_pre_deploy_tests
    - deploy_to_staging
    - run_smoke_tests
    - deploy_to_production
    - run_post_deploy_verification
  rollback:
    enabled: true
    trigger_on_failure: true
```

## Monitoring Setup
- Authentication endpoint response times
- Failed login attempt rates
- JWT token validation errors
- Email delivery success rates
- Database connection health

## Notes
This implementation follows industry best practices for authentication security. The JWT implementation uses RS256 algorithm with proper key rotation support.

The deployment includes feature flags for gradual rollout:
- `auth_v2_enabled` - Controls new authentication system
- `email_verification_required` - Controls email verification requirement
- `rate_limiting_strict` - Controls strict vs. lenient rate limiting
