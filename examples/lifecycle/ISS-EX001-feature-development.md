# Issue: User Authentication Feature Development

## Description
Implement a complete user authentication system including registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality. The system should use JWT tokens for session management and include proper security measures against common attacks.

## State Transition History
- **2025-07-14T08:00:00Z**: Created in `planning` state by product-manager
- **2025-07-14T09:15:00Z**: Transitioned to `ready_for_engineering` by product-manager
  - Reason: Requirements approved, design mockups completed
  - Automation eligible: Yes

## Requirements
- Secure user registration with email verification
- Login/logout with JWT token management
- Password reset via email
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for security events

## Tasks
- TSK-EX001: Database schema for user accounts
- TSK-EX002: Authentication API endpoints
- TSK-EX003: Frontend authentication components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email verification
- [ ] Users can login and receive JWT token
- [ ] Password reset functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] All inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Security audit requirements are met
- [ ] Frontend integration is complete

## Next State Transitions
When development is complete, this issue will transition to:
- **ready_for_qa**: Code review passed, ready for testing
  - Required metadata: reviewer, automation_source (if automated)
  - Automation eligible: Yes (if all tests pass)

## Dependencies
- Database schema design must be finalized
- Security audit requirements document
- JWT library evaluation and selection

## Notes
This is a critical security feature that requires careful implementation and thorough testing. Consider involving security team in code review.

Security considerations:
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement proper JWT token expiration
- Add CSRF protection
- Include audit logging for failed attempts
