# Task: Database Schema for User Accounts

## Description
Create database schema for user authentication including tables for users, sessions, password resets, and audit logs. Include migration scripts and proper indexing for performance.

## State Transition History
- **2025-07-14T09:20:00Z**: Created in `planning` state by developer-alice
- **2025-07-14T10:00:00Z**: Transitioned to `active` by developer-alice
  - Reason: Started implementation after design approval
- **2025-07-14T14:30:00Z**: Transitioned to `ready_for_qa` by ci-pipeline
  - Reason: Implementation complete, all unit tests passing
  - Reviewed by: senior-dev-bob
  - Automation eligible: Yes

## Implementation Details
- Created `users` table with proper constraints
- Added `user_sessions` for JWT token tracking  
- Implemented `password_resets` for reset workflow
- Created `auth_audit_log` for security monitoring
- Added proper indexes for query performance
- Database migration scripts with rollback support

## Testing Required
- [ ] Schema validation tests
- [ ] Migration script testing (up and down)
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Security constraint validation
- [ ] Index effectiveness analysis

## Files Changed
- `migrations/001_create_users_table.sql`
- `migrations/002_create_sessions_table.sql`
- `migrations/003_create_audit_log.sql`
- `tests/database/schema_test.py`
- `docs/database_design.md`

## Next State Transitions
When QA testing is complete, this task will transition to:
- **ready_for_deployment**: All tests passed, ready for production
  - Required metadata: qa_reviewer, test_results
  - Automation eligible: Yes (if integration tests pass)

## QA Checklist
- [ ] Migration scripts run successfully
- [ ] All constraints properly enforced
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 100ms queries)
- [ ] Security validations working
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation is accurate

## Notes
Schema includes soft delete functionality and created_at/updated_at timestamps on all tables. Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity.

Performance considerations:
- Indexed email field for fast user lookups
- Composite index on (user_id, created_at) for session queries
- Proper varchar lengths to optimize storage
