# Issue: Legacy Issue After Migration

## Description
This is the same legacy issue after migration to the unified state management system. It demonstrates how legacy tickets are enhanced with rich state metadata while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Summary
- **Migration Date**: 2025-07-14T12:00:00Z
- **Migration Source**: legacy-status-migration
- **Original Status**: active
- **New State**: active
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy status field preserved

## Enhanced State Information
- **Current State**: active (with rich metadata)
- **State Metadata**: Full transition tracking enabled
- **Automation Eligible**: Yes
- **Previous State**: planning (inferred from creation pattern)

## State Transition History
- **2025-07-01T10:00:00Z**: Created in `planning` state (inferred)
- **2025-07-10T15:30:00Z**: Transitioned to `active` (inferred from update)
- **2025-07-14T12:00:00Z**: Enhanced with state metadata during migration

## Migration Benefits Gained
✅ **Rich State Metadata**: Detailed transition information  
✅ **Automation Support**: Ready for CI/CD integration  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Enhanced tracking capabilities  
✅ **Workflow Integration**: Compatible with approval processes  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy tools continue to work  

## Tasks
- TSK-LEGACY-001: Legacy task implementation (also migrated)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Add basic tests
- [ ] Update documentation

## Available State Transitions
From current `active` state, can transition to:
- `ready_for_qa`: When development is complete
- `ready_for_engineering`: If requirements change
- `won_t_do`: If cancelled or descoped
- `planning`: If needs to go back to planning

## Next Steps for Enhanced Workflow
1. **Development Completion**: Transition to `ready_for_qa`
   - Add reviewer information
   - Include automation eligibility
   - Document transition reason

2. **Quality Assurance**: Transition to `ready_for_deployment`
   - QA team review and approval
   - Test result documentation
   - Deployment readiness verification

3. **Production Deployment**: Transition to `done`
   - Deployment automation integration
   - Production monitoring confirmation
   - Business objective completion

## Migration Validation
✅ **Data Integrity**: All original data preserved  
✅ **Status Mapping**: Correct state assignment  
✅ **Metadata Generation**: Appropriate metadata created  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy status field maintained  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Migration properly logged  

## Integration Readiness
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Can now trigger on state transitions
- **Automation Tools**: Can read and update state metadata
- **Reporting Systems**: Access to rich state information
- **Approval Workflows**: Ready for review process integration

## Notes
This migrated issue now supports all modern workflow features while maintaining full compatibility with existing systems that rely on the legacy status field.

The migration process:
1. Analyzed original status and update history
2. Generated appropriate state metadata
3. Preserved all original data
4. Added migration audit information
5. Enabled automation capabilities
