# Task: Test Epic Management Commands

## Description
Comprehensive testing of all epic management CLI commands including create, list, show, update, complete, and delete operations.

## Steps
1. **Help Testing**
   - [x] Test `aitrackdown epic --help`
   - [x] Test `aitrackdown epic create --help`
   - [ ] Test help for all epic subcommands

2. **Read Operations**
   - [x] Test `aitrackdown epic list`
   - [x] Test `aitrackdown epic show EP-0001`
   - [ ] Test filtering and sorting options

3. **Write Operations** 
   - [ ] Test `aitrackdown epic create` (failing with fs module issue)
   - [ ] Test `aitrackdown epic update`
   - [ ] Test `aitrackdown epic complete`
   - [ ] Test `aitrackdown epic delete`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All epic commands execute without errors
- [ ] Help system is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Output formatting is consistent and readable
- [ ] Error handling provides helpful messages
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is properly managed

## Issues Found
1. **Dynamic require of "fs" error** - CLI creation commands fail with module import issue
2. **Status command not reading items** - Status doesn't detect existing epics/issues/tasks

## Notes
Read operations work well, but write operations have module import issues that need resolution.
