# Issue: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

## Description
Establish the foundational TypeScript project with Commander.js integration, modern build system, and proper NPM package configuration for cross-platform distribution.

## ✅ Completed Acceptance Criteria
- [x] TypeScript project initialized with proper tsconfig.json
- [x] Commander.js integration with basic command structure
- [x] tsup build configuration for dual ESM/CJS output
- [x] Package.json configured with bin, main, module, exports fields
- [x] Shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) implemented for cross-platform execution
- [x] Basic error handling and process exit codes

## ✅ Modern Toolchain Implementation
- [x] Biome configuration for fast linting and formatting (replaced ESLint + Prettier)
- [x] Vitest configuration for fast testing (replaced Jest)
- [x] TypeScript compilation with Node.js 16+ compatibility
- [x] Cross-platform executable CLI working correctly
- [x] Professional CLI structure with proper command hierarchy

## Related Tasks
- TSK-0009: TypeScript and Commander.js Setup (COMPLETED)
- TSK-0010: Build System Configuration (COMPLETED)
- TSK-0011: NPM Package Setup (COMPLETED)

## Technical Achievements
- **Bundle Size**: 447KB (well under 5MB target)
- **Startup Time**: Fast startup confirmed
- **Build System**: Dual ESM/CJS output with source maps
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility

## Notes
This phase was completed successfully on 2025-07-07 with all acceptance criteria met and modern toolchain implemented. Foundation is solid for subsequent development phases.
