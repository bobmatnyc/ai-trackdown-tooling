# Issue: Trackdown Ticket Migration

## Description
Convert the existing trackdown tickets (ATT-001, ATT-002, ATT-003) to the new ai-trackdown hierarchical structure while preserving all content and ensuring proper relationships.

## Tasks
- TSK-0006: Migrate ATT-001 CLI Foundation
- TSK-0007: Migrate ATT-002 Configurable Directory Root
- TSK-0008: Migrate ATT-003 Complete Redesign

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All original ticket content is preserved
- [ ] Proper Epic → Issue → Task hierarchy is established
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is correctly formatted
- [ ] AI context markers are added appropriately
- [ ] Token estimates are carried over
- [ ] Status mappings are accurate

## Migration Strategy
1. **Analysis**: Review existing ticket structure and content
2. **Mapping**: Define Epic/Issue/Task breakdown for each ticket
3. **Conversion**: Create new files with proper YAML frontmatter
4. **Validation**: Verify all content is preserved and relationships work
5. **Testing**: Confirm CLI can read and process migrated items

## Notes
Ensure zero data loss during migration and maintain traceability to original tickets.
