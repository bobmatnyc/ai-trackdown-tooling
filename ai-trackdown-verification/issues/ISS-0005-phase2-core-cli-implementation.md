# Issue: Phase 2 - Core CLI Implementation

## Description
Implement the core CLI functionality including command hierarchy, argument parsing with validation, professional styling, and comprehensive help system for optimal user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command hierarchy implemented (init, track, status, export, epic, issue, task, ai)
- [ ] Argument parsing with validation and type checking
- [ ] Professional styling with colors and formatting (Chalk integration)
- [ ] Comprehensive help system with examples and usage guides
- [ ] Configuration file support (YAML)
- [ ] Error messages with helpful suggestions

## Current Progress
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Basic command structure with Commander.js
- [x] Help system framework
- [x] Epic command group (list, show working)
- [x] Task command group (list working)
- [x] AI command group (generate-llms-txt working)
- [x] Init command (project initialization working)

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Epic creation commands (failing with fs module error)
- [ ] Issue command implementation (partially implemented)
- [ ] Task creation commands (failing with fs module error)
- [ ] Status command item detection (not reading existing items)

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Professional styling and colors
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Comprehensive validation

## Related Tasks
- TSK-0012: Command Hierarchy Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
- TSK-0013: Argument Parsing and Validation (PENDING)
- TSK-0014: Professional Styling Implementation (PENDING)
- TSK-0015: Help System and Documentation (IN PROGRESS)

## Issues Identified
1. **Dynamic require of "fs" error** - Creation commands fail with module import issue
2. **Status command item detection** - Not properly reading existing project items
3. **Issue command gaps** - List and show commands not fully implemented

## Next Steps
1. Fix the fs module import issue in creation commands
2. Implement missing issue and task show/list commands
3. Fix status command to properly detect project items
4. Add professional styling and enhanced UX

## Notes
Core architecture is in place but creation commands need debugging. Read operations work well, indicating the foundation is solid.
