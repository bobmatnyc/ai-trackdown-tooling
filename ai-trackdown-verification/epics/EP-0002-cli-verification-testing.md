# Epic: CLI Verification Testing

## Overview
This epic covers comprehensive testing of the ai-trackdown CLI functionality and migration of existing trackdown tickets to the new ai-trackdown structure.

## Objectives
- [ ] Verify all CLI commands work correctly
- [ ] Test hierarchical relationships (Epic → Issue → Task)
- [ ] Validate AI features (token tracking, context management, llms.txt generation)
- [ ] Migrate existing trackdown tickets to ai-trackdown format
- [ ] Ensure data integrity during migration
- [ ] Verify ai-trackdown compliance

## Success Criteria
- All CLI commands execute without errors
- Hierarchical structure works correctly
- AI features generate proper output
- Existing tickets successfully converted
- Migration preserves all original content
- Project provides comprehensive status overview

## Migration Tasks
1. Convert ATT-001-CLI-FOUNDATION.md to epic/issues/tasks
2. Convert ATT-002-CONFIGURABLE-DIRECTORY-ROOT.md to epic/issues/tasks
3. Convert ATT-003-COMPLETE-REDESIGN-AI-TRACKDOWN-COMPLIANCE.md to epic/issues/tasks

## Notes
This epic validates the production readiness of the ai-trackdown CLI tool.
